      <description>Memory allocation seems to be something many people struggle with it. Many languages try to automatically handle memory for you using different strategies: garbage collection (GC), automatic reference counting (ARC), resource acquisition is initialization (RAII), and ownership semantics. However, trying to abstract away memory allocation comes at a higher cost than most people realize.
Most people are taught to think of memory in terms of the stack and the heap, where the stack is automatically grown for a procedure call, and the heap is some magical thing that you can use to get memory that needs to live longer than the stack.</description>
