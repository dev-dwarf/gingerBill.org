      <description>I have recently been thinking about multiple return values as a concept, and wondering if there has been any kind of literature into the topic of &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; multiple return values which are not emulated through tuples. My current working hypothesis is that I think I have come to the conclusion (unless there is evidence to the contrary) Odin has invented a new kind of type system, something to the akin of polyadic expressions.</description>
