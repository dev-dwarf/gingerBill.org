      <description>Absolute Pointers Pointers are a value type in programming languages that store a memory address. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at this location in memory is known as dereferencing a pointer. Pointers are part and parcel of using languages like C, and are an extremely powerful tool. Pointers can be treated as a form of reference type, a value that refers to another typed value in memory.</description>

      <description>I read the article Let&amp;rsquo;s stop copying C about 3 years ago. Recently someone brought it up again and I thought I would comment on the points being made. The article argues that newer languages ought not to copy the mistakes of C and comment on may of C&amp;rsquo;s mistakes.
I recommend reading the original article first before reading this one as I will be commenting directly on the subsections of the article.</description>
